I've known about the concept of "Yes, and..." for a while through various blog posts or other publications that have tried to make the cross-over between improv and leadership. At face value it seems like great advice. I'll admit, I was a sucker for its siren song of team-building potential at first.

The idea is that instead of shutting down others' ideas, you say "Yes, and..." and build off of them. In improv, when someone suggests something and you reject their idea, you're killing the momentum and it throws everyone off. You should just accept what they've done and build on top of it. The translation to business is that you should accept others' ideas as valid and stop trying to control situations by only promoting your own ideas exclusively.

I even tried to tell my dad about the magic of "Yes, and" only to have him reply "That's ridiculous, you can't say yes to everything. You have to say no sometimes." I thought he just didn't _get it_ and I felt sorry that he couldn't grasp such inspired wisdom.

After years of bandying about what I took to be dogma, I saw "Yes, and" behavior in real life, and it felt like more like gas-lighting than inspiration. 

In improv, it doesn't really matter the outcome of your scene; you're just trying to be entertaining. "Yes, and" really works here because the _only_ thing that matters is the momentum of the scene. If the scene includes your troup robbing a bank and one of you dying because you brought a novelty flower gun, it doesn't matter because you're just acting. There are no repercussions and saying "Yes, and" is great advice.

In a business setting, the decisions that are made actually have real-life outcomes. Let's say you've made a deck with 50 slides on it showing off designs of various user stories. You show your boss these designs and a conversation ensues: 

Boss: "These are great, except I'm not a fan of the icons. Can you use a different style of icons?"
You: "Sure, no problem. Changing them out in every Sketch file, exporting them to PNGs and replacing all the slides in the Powerpoint might take a while. Would it be alright if I just add an appendix to show the new proposed icon style?"
Boss: "Yes, and we should also make the deck look exactly how the developers are going to make it."

Your boss isn't injecting his ego into the situation and is graciously accepting your ideas by saying "Yes, and"; such a powerful, selfless leader! But, right afterwards he directly contradicts the meaning of your idea with his own idea. So now instead of being direct and saying "No, rework all of the files please" he gets to pretend like everything is awesome and you're both right, even though the outcome is the same as saying "No".

This whole interaction is disheartening at its core because it's so inauthentic. The employee expressed themselves and it was completely ignored. Specifically for that reason, they also don't really have any recourse in the situation. Their request wasn't rejected, _it wasn't even acknowledged in the first place_. Whatever follow-up statement you bring up will just get the "Yes, and" treatment as well. You can say whatever you like, there will just be other opinions which will always outrank yours with no honest discussion.

You might reject this use of "Yes, and" by saying that's not the intention of phrase. If there's some sort of rule that you're not allowed to undermine other people's ideas with your own, then the boss must accept that the employee will only change one slide. In this case, the boss is just accepting whatever anyone else says. Obviously, they won't be effective at their job if they keep that up. "Yes, and" is either passive acceptance of everything you hear, or it's doubletalk. There is no middle ground here.

At the end of the day, a choice is going to have to be made and opening up an honest line of discussion with your employees seems like the right thing to do. Diligently listen to their thoughts, consider the situation, make a choice and explain why the choice is being made transparently. They may not like the decision, but at least they'll feel heard.

Maybe my dad was onto something after all.
